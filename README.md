# **StankNG**

```
Kickstart a new Angular v12+ project with readability, maintainability, and simplicity in mind.
```

## Introduction
---

This project is another Angular starter project that can be used to jumpstart any new application. As I've used Angular more and more, I've tried numerous different project setups to see what works and what doesn't. I finally feel comfortable with this project structure. If you at least somewhat follow the practices/conventions being used in this example project, I firmly believe it will help you maintain your project.

> **NOTE:** There's no "one-best-way" to structure a project. Use whatever works for you and/or your team. This example project itself *will* change over time.

## Requirements
---

1. Node 12.15+
3. Angular CLI v12 (```npm install @angular/cli@12```)

## Getting Started
---

> **Make sure you meet the requirements before trying to run the project.**

Running this project should be very quick and easy. It's essentially just as easy as creating a new Angular app, if not easier.

1. Clone repository
2. Navigate to repository directory on local machine and run `npm install`
3. Run `ng serve`
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view your application
5. Done!

## More Information Coming Soon...

This README will be updated to explain the structure of this project.

For now, enjoy exploring the code yourself. There isn't much here, so it should be easy to follow.
